Click on the yellow squares of the
grid so to write numbers in them.
At first all the squares of the grid
are yellow, so click anywhere. Now,
a certain yellow pattern is drawn
around the square you just clicked
(see first figure).

You can click on any of the yellow
squares so to write the next
number in it. Of course the yellow
pattern is somewhat different now
because there cannot be a yellow
square to where a number is all- 
ready written (second figure).

Keep on clicking the yellow squares
until all the grid is filled with
numbers up to 100.

A good strategy is to start from a
corner and gradually move to the
center with a clockwise motion.
Good luck !!!
